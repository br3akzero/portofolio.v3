        <h1>Building Notar Exchange at ETHGlobal</h1>
      </header>

      <article class="blog-content">
        <p>Hackathons have a special kind of energy. The pressure, the caffeine, the wild ideas that somehow come together at 3 AM. This September, my friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sulejman-sarajlija/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sulejman Sarajlija</a> and I decided to throw our hats in the ring at ETHGlobal. What came out of it was <strong>Notar Exchange</strong> — and honestly, it was one of the most fun projects I've ever built.</p>

        <h2>The Problem We Tackled</h2>

        <p>If you've ever tried to exchange crypto for fiat in a second or third-world country, you know the pain. Payment providers are either unavailable, unreliable, or charge astronomical fees. We were inspired by <strong>zkp2p</strong>, but we wanted to adapt the concept to work with <strong>Wise</strong> — a payment platform that's more accessible globally.</p>

        <p>The challenge? Building a trustless peer-to-peer exchange protocol where two strangers can swap crypto for fiat without needing to trust each other or rely on a custodian. No intermediaries. No "please don't scam me" moments.</p>

        <h2>The Build</h2>

        <p>Sulejman took on the backend, architecting the smart contracts and integrating with the <strong>Scroll blockchain</strong>. I handled the frontend, building an interface that made the whole trustless exchange feel... well, trustworthy. It's one thing to have secure contracts running on-chain; it's another to convince users they're safe.</p>

        <p>We worked fast. Really fast. But the kind of fast where you're not just hacking things together — you're making real decisions about architecture, security, and user experience on the fly. Every choice mattered. Every bug was a learning opportunity (or a panic moment, depending on the time of day).</p>

        <h2>Why It Was So Fun</h2>

        <p>There's something magical about building alongside someone who just <em>gets it</em>. Sulejman and I synced up almost immediately. He'd finish a contract method, I'd wire it up in the UI, and we'd test it together. When something broke (and oh, things broke), we debugged it as a team.</p>

        <p>The best part? We weren't just building for the judges. We were solving a real problem that affects real people. Knowing that Notar Exchange could actually help someone in an underserved market exchange assets securely made every late-night coding session worth it.</p>

        <h2>The Win</h2>

        <p>We didn't just submit a project — we won. <strong>Notar Exchange took home an ETHGlobal award.</strong> It validated everything we built, but more than that, it proved that good ideas, solid execution, and great collaboration can happen in a matter of days.</p>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>

        <p>Hackathon projects often live and die in a weekend. But Notar Exchange feels different. We built something that works, something that matters. Whether it evolves into a full product or remains a proof of concept, it's out there — a testament to what's possible when you mix blockchain, creative problem-solving, and a bit of sleep deprivation.</p>

        <p>If you want to check it out, the project is live on the <a href="https://ethglobal.com/showcase/notar-exchange-dwgr5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETHGlobal Showcase</a>.</p>

        <p>And if you're curious about Sulejman's work, check out his <a href="https://sule.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">portfolio</a> — the guy's a backend wizard.</p>

        <p>Here's to more hackathons, more late nights, and more projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.</p>
